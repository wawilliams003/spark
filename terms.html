      <p>
        The Services may include prompts, decks, questions, text, graphics, icons, and other materials (“Spark Content”).
        Spark Content is owned by Spark or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws.

      <p>
        If the Services allow you to submit content (such as feedback or messages), you grant Spark a worldwide, non-exclusive,

        Payments are processed by your app store provider (e.g., Apple App Store). We do not collect your payment card details.

      </p>

      </p>

      <h3>4.5 Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Refunds are handled by the app store provider. Please review your app store’s refund policies and request refunds through

      </p>

      <h2 id="privacy">5. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of Spark is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and protect information.
        By using Spark, you consent to the data practices described in the Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2 id="disclaimers">6. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SPARK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
        WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
        AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spark does not guarantee that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any prompts will lead to a
        particular outcome in your relationships. Your use is at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h2 id="liability">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SPARK AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE
        FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED
        DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your access to or use of (or inability to access or use) the Services;</li>
        <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Services;</li>
        <li>Any content obtained from the Services; or</li>
        <li>Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In no event will Spark’s aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Services exceed the amount you paid to Spark
        (if any) for the Services in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or $100, whichever is greater.
      </p>

      <h2 id="indemnity">8. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Spark and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and licensors from
        and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
        arising from: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms; or (c) your violation of any rights of a third party.
      </p>

      <h2 id="termination">9. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms
        or if required to protect the Services, users, or the public. You may stop using the Services at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon termination, your license to use the Services ends. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive, including
        intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute provisions.
      </p>

      <h2 id="changes">10. Changes to the Services or Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update the Services and these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we may provide notice in the App or by
        other reasonable means. Your continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2 id="thirdparty">11. Third-Party Services & App Store Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Spark may integrate with or link to third-party services (such as sharing via Messages). We are not responsible for third-party
        services and your use of them is governed by their terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you downloaded the App from the Apple App Store, you also agree to Apple’s applicable terms, including the Apple Media Services
        Terms and Conditions. Apple is not responsible for Spark, and Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the App.
      </p>
